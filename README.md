Book Club!
==========

Repository for tracking information regarding our book club.

Ideas:
* If you're in the book club, watch this repo. Then you should get
  notifications when things change.
* Each meeting can be tracked as a separate Github issue. If anyone
  finds supplemental material, add it to the issue.

## Meeting schedule

* Meet roughly every two weeks to discuss a chapter
* On intervening weeks we can meet to work through examples

## Suggestions?

* pull requests? eh?
